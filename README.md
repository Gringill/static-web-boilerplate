# Boilerplate for quick static site setup

This boilerplate will fit your workflow only if you use Stylus, Jade and CoffeeScript.

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nepsilon/static-web-boilerplate.git <your-project-dir>
cd <your-project-dir>
make install
```

## Getting Started

Use `make watch` to  start a local webserver and watch the files in the `/src` folder. When any change is seen, the build process (`make build`) will be triggred.


## Other Usage

`make reset` to reset the `/public` folder to its original state.
`make build` to manually trigger the build process.
`make server` to start the local webserver.
`make install` to install the dependencies.


## TODO

* Find a fast live reload equivalent
* Use `make` features to run taks in parallel when possible
* Ensure only changed files are being built at each change
* Minify the files in the public folder
* Add a `make deploy` target to deploy to an S3 bucket or via SSH.
